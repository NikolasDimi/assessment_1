      <h1>Interest in IT </h1>
      <p>If I was to say one thing that I find interesting about IT it would be how it can be used to make aspects of my life easier/better. As for when this interest started, I’m not really sure. However, I did grow up playing the GameCube (since I was like 2) so there’s that. I currently don’t have any IT experience or at least none related to employment if that was what was being asked.</p>
      <p>I chose to come to RMIT because I was looking for a change from what I was previously studying. I thought that maybe IT would be something I would enjoy doing or at least I would be able to use the skills learnt throughout the course outside of a job. And then I found RMIT’s online course and yeah, that’s how I got here.</p>
      <p>I expect that I will learn skills necessary for me to be employed in an IT related field once I’ve completed the course. That is generally the reason for starting the course, isn’t it?</p>
