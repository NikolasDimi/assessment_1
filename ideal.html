      <h1>Personal Ideal Job</h1>
      <h6 style="color: red;">*I don‚Äôt necessarily want this job just had to pick something </h6>
      <h4><strong>Description of Position/What makes it interesting</strong></h4>
      <p>Basically, this job is using Unity to create an iPad game. This job is appealing to me because I think that game development would be a more interesting and enjoyable career path than most of the other jobs out there. However, I don‚Äôt have any experience with game development so this is just speculation.</p>
      <h4><strong>Description of Skills/Qualifications/ Experience Required</strong></h4>
      <p>You would need to be quite fluent with using Unity for game creation specifically with iPad games and enabling it to work with Facebook. From memory, I think Unity uses C# so id assume you would have to know that to a pretty high level as well. You would also have to be able to work well with the other people involved in the project.</p>
      <h4><strong>Description of Skills/Qualifications/ Experience I have</strong></h4>
      <p>Literally none, I‚Äôm a noob lol üòù. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm taking this course though. To change that</p>
      <h4><strong>Plan for how I will obtain the skills</strong></h4>
      <p>Well, the first step would probably be finishing this course. Hopefully I would have covered most of the relevant areas such as programming and game development. Assuming that I wouldn‚Äôt have specifically covered Unity and C# I would have to learn those as well. It would also be preferable to have some real job experience working on similar smaller projects as well.</p>
