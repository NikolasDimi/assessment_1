      <h1>Project Idea</h1>
      <p>Overview: My idea for the project is DS/3DS capture hardware. What this would be is a way for the Nintendo DS/3DS consoles to be displayed/recorded that is both consistently accessible and affordable</p>
      <p>Motivation: The motivation for this project is that the consoles have been out starting in 2004 and have had no consistent way to display/record/stream gameplay. This would specifically be useful Nintendo DS/3DS game speedrunners and or streamers/content creators who want to showcase their gameplay without the use of emulators.</p>
      <p>Description: What this product would be is a way for the Nintendo DS/3DS to be able to display their screens on computer. Allowing for Streaming/Recording of gameplay. This would most likely be done through installing a capture card into the console. There isn’t really anymore to specify about this…</p>
      <p>Skills: Well firstly creating there is creating the capture card. So, both the hardware and software creation skills are necessary for that. You would also need to be able to install it into the console. As for finding someone capable of doing this. The installation part should theoretically be quite simple. This is however judging based on previous capture cards available. So, it would depend on the finished product. I’m not sure of the skills necessary to create the actual capture card software/hardware.</p>
      <p>Outcome: If the project is successful. The outcome will be an accessible DS/3DS capture card that allows people to stream/record gameplay which would then hopefully become widely available. </p>
